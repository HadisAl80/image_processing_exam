# Image Processing Project

## Description

This project demonstrates basic image processing tasks using OpenCV and Matplotlib in Python. The code reads an image (`sample.jpg`), processes it by converting it to grayscale, resizing it, and applying Gaussian blur. The processed images are saved in separate files and displayed using Matplotlib.

### The project includes:
- **Grayscale Conversion**: Converts the input image to grayscale.
- **Resizing**: Resizes the image to 100x100 pixels.
- **Blurring**: Applies Gaussian blur to the image.

These processed images are saved as `grayscale_sample.jpg`, `resized_sample.jpg`, and `blurred_sample.jpg`. The processed images are displayed side by side using Matplotlib.

## Requirements

Before running the code, make sure you have the following Python packages installed:

- `opencv-python`: For reading and processing images.
- `matplotlib`: For displaying the processed images.

To install these dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
